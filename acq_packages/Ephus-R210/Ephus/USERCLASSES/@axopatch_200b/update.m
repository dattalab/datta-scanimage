% UPDATE - Method that will update the amplifier with the current hardware
% settings.
%
% SYNTAX
%  obj = update(obj);
%
% USAGE
%  This method will call the appropriate method so that the multi_clamp
%  object will contain the correct input and output gains based on the
%  hardware settings.
%
% NOTES
%
% CHANGES
%  TO021005b - Moved indexTelegraph from being a subfunction in update to a private function. -- Tim O'Connor 2/10/05
%  TO022305c - Changed this to pick up the new variable(s) 'gain_daq_board_id'. -- Tim O'Connor 2/23/05
%  TO062405B - Send update notifications. -- Tim O'Connor 6/24/05
%  TO010906A - Optimization(s). Only notify listeners if there has been a change. -- Tim O'Connor 1/9/06
%  TO080606B - Use the daqmanager, like it should have originally, to avoid conflicts (see TO080406E). -- Tim O'Connor 8/6/06
%  TO073107B - Change over to nimex. -- Tim O'Connor 7/31/07
%  TO121507A - Mode is a string, not a scalar, use `strcmpi`. -- Tim O'Connor 12/15/07
%  TO050508A - Something of a kluge, to handle the sharing of a single board across programs. The board may need to be "silently" restarted here. -- Tim O'Connor 5/5/08
%  TO050508B - Do some averaging of telegraph samples, which may be a bit slower, but sometimes these lines can get noisey. -- Tim O'Connor 5/5/08
%  TO082708B - Gracefully handle failures in reading samples, which is not necessarily really bad news, if we already have the correct amplifier state. -- Tim O'Connor 8/27/08

function out = update(obj)
%Um, why is this being done? Oh, right, this didn't originally use pointers it was "pure" Matlab class (which is not a good thing). 
%It's like our design discussions went in one ear and out the other. More than a year and a half later and there's still kruft from that time. -- Tim O'Connor 8/6/06
out = obj; % copy input...

%TO080606B - This was implemented all wrong upon creation. It should not create analoginput objects, and it certainly should not
%            assume that all the telegraphs will be read in on the same board. How crap like this got written, I'll never know...
%TODO (as of 8/6/06) - Implement this as a single call to getDaqSample (which will currently print a warning, since the multichannel
%                      functionality is not optimally implemented, yet).
% setup the daq to read the telegraphs.

% addchannel(aiobject_default,[get(out,'gain_channel') get(out,'mode_channel') get(out,'v_hold_channel')]);
% gain_mode_vhold = getsample(aiobject_default); % get telegraph voltages
% delete(aiobject_default);
% dm = getDaqmanager;%Using the default daqmanager object may be a little bit conflict prone, but will most likely be okay. It's cleaner than attaching a @daqmanager instance to the object.
